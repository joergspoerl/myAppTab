  What is Ionic Framework?
  Ionic Framework is an open source SDK that enables developers to build performant, high-quality mobile apps using familiar web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
  
  Ionic is focused mainly on the look and feel, or the UI interaction, of an app. This means that it’s not a replacement for PhoneGap or your favorite JavaScript framework. Instead, Ionic fits in well with these projects, in order to simplify one big part of your app development process: the front-end. Check out “Where does the Ionic Framework fit in?” to get a good understanding of Ionic’s core philosophy and goals.
  
  Ionic currently requires Angular in order to work at its full potential. While you can still use the CSS portion of the framework, you’ll miss out on powerful UI interactions, gestures, animations, and other things. In the future, Ionic plans to become more agnostic in order to support a broader variety of JavaScript frameworks.
